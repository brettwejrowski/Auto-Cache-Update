/*
* Use this php function on paths images, css, js, or other media to force a path based on the files modified date
* Good for dev sites to ensure Users will not cache newly updated files 
* (no more telling a client "oh... yeah update your cache... thats why it isn't working")
* 
* Can possibly be used with far future expires headers to improve performance and auto clear when files are updated.
* Performance of php has not been tested though.
*
* 
* usage: 
*
*	<script src="<?c( '/javascripts/myscript.js' )?>" ></script>
*	
*		- or - 
*	
*	<link type="text/css" rel="stylesheet" media="all" href="<?c('/css/global.css')?>" />
*
*		- or - 
*
*	<img src="<?c('/images/myimg.jpg')?>"
